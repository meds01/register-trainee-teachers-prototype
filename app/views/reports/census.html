        About this export
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        This export includes trainees that are likely to be included in the {{ academicYear }} ITT census. The ITT census counts trainees registered on a course on the second Wednesday of October every academic year, this is sometimes called the ‘census date’.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The census date for the {{ academicYear }} academic year is Wednesday 12 October {{academicYearShort}}.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">This export will include trainees:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          that are registered (so their records are not drafts in Register) 
        </li>
        <li>
          on their first year of training 
        </li>
        <li>
          on ITT courses starting from 1 August {{ academicYearShort }} and the census date
        </li>
        <li>
          that started their training on or before the census date
        </li>
        <li>
          on courses leading to qualified teacher status (QTS)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">This export will not include trainees on the Assessment only route or trainees who started training but then withdrew before the census date.
  .</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How this export will be different from the ITT census</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        All trainees that should be included in the ITT census will be in this export, but there might be a small number of extra trainees that would not normally be included. This is because Register currently does not have a way to exclude them. Trainees who could be in this export are:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          trainees without a start date because we cannot know if a trainee started their course on or before the census date without a start date
        </li>
        <li>
          trainees that are self funded (not eligible for UK financial support and do not have a DfE allocated place) — the ITT census excludes these trainees. 
        </li>
      </ul>
